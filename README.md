# AVC Robot for Four-Quadrant Obstacle Course

This project aims to develop an AVC robot capable of navigating all four-quadrants in VUW AVC Project obstacle course. The robot must complete various tasks in each quadrant, including opening gates, following lines, navigating mazes, and interacting with obstacles.

## Project Description

The AVC robot project integrates electrical and software engineering disciplines to build a compact and efficient robot. The robot successfully navigates through the obstacle course, demonstrating its abilities in navigation, obstacle detection, and decision-making.

## Features

- Autonomous navigation through a four-quadrant obstacle course.
- Task completion in each quadrant, including gate opening, line following, maze navigation, and obstacle interaction.
- Integration of hardware components and software algorithms to achieve desired functionality.
